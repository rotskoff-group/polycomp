#polycomp

Python implementation of polymer field theory with an emphasis on flexibility, 
accessibility, and speed. 

Our current development has placed an emphasis on simulations 
of charged linear polymers, but the platform is flexible and we plan to continue 
development on many systems. The code runs only on GPUs due to the computational cost
of the simulations.
