# Getting Started

## Installation

As the code is still under active development, it should be installed by downloading 
from our [github](https://github.com/rotskoff-group/polycomp) and installing locally via 

    pip install -e .

We look forward to building a conda package for easier installation in the near future. 

## Managing dependencies

You can find all of the required packages prepared in a single conda environment which
can be installed via

    conda env create --file polycomp.yml

## Running the tests

You can make sure that your installation has worked by running 

    python tests.py

from the tests directory.
