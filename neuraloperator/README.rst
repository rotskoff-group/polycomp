Neural Operator
===============

``neuraloperator`` is a comprehensive library for 
learning neural operators in PyTorch.
It is the official implementation for Fourier Neural Operators 
and Tensorized Neural Operators.

Unlike regular neural networks, neural operators
enable learning mapping between function spaces, and this library
provides all of the tools to do so on your own data.

NeuralOperators are also resolution invariant, 
so your trained operator can be applied on data of any resolution.
